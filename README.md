# RaidShardPullCalculator

Welcome to my page! 

Use the SetRates class to adjust summon rates if I have not done so already. [Currently the 2x Void rates are live.]

Then, run the RunCalc class to crunch all the values for your shards!

As of 7/10/2020, only the legendary rates will be posted. Epics and commons are in plans for future developments.
