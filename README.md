# RaidShardPullCalculator

Welcome to my page! 

Use the SetRates class to adjust summon rates if I have not done so already. [Currently, no special rates are live.]

Then, run the RunCalc class to crunch all the values for your shards!

As of 7/22/2020, a simulation feature was created to mathematically represent all probabilities. Visual graphics, names, and charts are the next goal.
